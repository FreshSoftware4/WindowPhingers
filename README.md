# WindowPhingers
A modification of the phingers cursor pack for windows made using only the most hacky cursor editing techniques. In total I attribute this creation 5% to skill, 10% to flexibility, and 85% to luck.

The loading icon was added from the oxygen zion pack frame by frame using copy paste because luckily the cursors were the right shape and size that even with rectangle selection they did not overlap, and for some reason the editor had the option to add a location/person icon which perfectly matched the theme, so I added those as well for the sake of full completion.

The .inf file was taken from a random icon pack and modified to add the person select and location select icons as well, which were not (and usually aren't for windows icon packs) included in said icon pack, and the files were renamed to match the .inf file names.
